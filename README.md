# Iris Dataset Predictive Model 📊

This project demonstrates a predictive modeling pipeline using the **Iris dataset**, one of the most famous datasets in machine learning. The goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

---

## Features 🚀

- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is scaled using `MinMaxScaler` to normalize feature ranges.
- **Polynomial Feature Engineering**: Adds higher-degree interactions for improved model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Utilizes a multinomial logistic regression classifier to handle multi-class classification effectively.
- **Pipeline Implementation**: Combines preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling into a single, seamless pipeline using `scikit-learn`.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy score on test data.
  - Detailed classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
  - Confusion matrix visualization for understanding misclassifications.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensures robustness and generalization with k-fold cross-validation.
- **Predictions on New Data**: Demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict on unseen inputs.

## About the Dataset 📄

The **Iris dataset** consists of 150 samples, each with four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width  

It categorizes samples into one of three species:
1. Iris-setosa
2. Iris-versicolor
3. Iris-virginica
